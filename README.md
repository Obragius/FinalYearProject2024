# Welcome to Air Traffic Puzzle Simulator

## Project Background

This is a project started by Daniels Zazerskis as Final Year Project in Kingston University London.
The aim of the project is "To support the safety and efficiency of Air Traffic Management including unmanned vehicles, despite the available human resources."
however the original aim was very ambitious but quite unneffective to communicate the goal of the application that has been produced as the result of the project.

Air Traffic Puzzle Simulator (Please suggest a shorter name) is an app that would allow yourself to create a realistic Air Traffic Managment situation and then
simulate such situation as an air traffic controller resolving any conflicts between aircraft and deciding on the best possible action in the situation as it unfolds.

## Project currently

As the project has been finished, it was decided to continue working on the application and a roadmap with 3 stages and a total of 6 objectives has been devised.
